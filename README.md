# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This project aims to recreate the classic arcade game frogger using different assets and rules. Guide the character to the water while dodging enemies and collecting gems along the way.

## Getting Started

A modern internet browser is needed in order to run the game, any browser newer than 2012 should suffice. When ready, obtain a copy of the project by either downloading a zipped version or using the below command in a terminal with **git** installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/logic0verflow/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
```

To start the game, simply open the **index.html** file.

### Character Selection

Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to change which character is selected. Use the **return** or **enter** key to confirm you selection and start playing!

### Gameplay

Guide the character to the water at the top of the map while avoiding enemies. The player loses all points and respawns at the beginning if hit by an enemy. Reaching the water grants 5 points but the player can earn points faster by collecting gems.

* blue gem = 10
* green gem = 20
* orange gem = 30

The player respawns after reaching the water and a new random gem can be obtained after each respawn.

### Gameplay Controls

Use arrow keys to move the character around the map;

* up arrow
* down arrow
* left arrow
* right arrow
